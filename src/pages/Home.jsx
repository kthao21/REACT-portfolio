      <p>
        I am a part time student learning full stack web development through UC Davis bootcamp. Skills I have learned so far include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS and MySQL. I aspire to design websites for small businesses to expand my portfolio. Outside of school, I work in a dental office as receptionist and dental assistant.
